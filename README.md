EarthView is a screensaver for Apple TV, displaying a random cycle of over 1500 beautiful satellite images of our planet's land and waters. EarthView supports both light and dark Apple TV display modes, and image fade and linger time control is available in Apple TV settings under Apps.

*Note: Due to Apple TV technical limitations, EarthView is not currently available as a native screensaver for your device - the app must be launched or switched to manually to display imagery.*
